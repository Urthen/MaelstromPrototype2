		p If creating a new account is not what you meant to do, we can delete it and pretend it never happened.
			| You won't be able to log into any applications at this time, but we won't remember any of your data from this login.
			| If you do want your account, however, we want to make sure we're out of your way. We recommend you enter your email address below.
			| We'll send you a one-time email to remind you about Maelstrom, provide some more information and helpful links, and provide a link
			| to confirm your email address. 
		p No pressure to give us your email just yet, but we know you're busy and don't want to read all this right now
			| and don't want you to forget. In the meantime, you'll be up and running with whatever it is you're doing. 
			| So what are you waiting for, lets get started!
